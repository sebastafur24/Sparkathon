# Sparkathon: 🩺 PulseGuard

💡 Product Description

PulseGuard is a smart safety and health monitoring band designed especially for the elderly.
It continuously tracks key vital signals such as heart rate, motion, and activity, detects anomalies or potential falls, and instantly alerts family members or caregivers in case of irregularities — ensuring that no moment of distress goes unnoticed.

Beyond monitoring, PulseGuard empowers seniors to live independent, confident, and connected lives — while giving families peace of mind that their loved ones are safe.

🌍 Mission

To safeguard the heart and wellbeing of every elderly person through intelligent, compassionate, and transparent technology.

We believe that aging with independence should never mean aging alone.
PulseGuard bridges technology and human connection — turning every heartbeat into a message of safety and care.

🔭 Vision

A world where no senior faces medical emergencies alone — where families, caregivers, and technology work together in harmony to protect life and dignity.

In the long term, PulseGuard aims to become the standard in intelligent elder care, combining wearable innovation, predictive health insights, and privacy-first design to support millions of families globally.

⚙️ How It Works

Continuous Monitoring:
Sensors track heart rate, motion, and activity patterns.

Smart Alerts:
If the system detects unusual heart activity or sudden movement patterns (e.g., a fall), it immediately sends alerts to caregivers via an app or SMS.

Real-Time Dashboard:
A simple mobile app displays real-time vitals and trends, helping families track wellbeing.

Consent-Based Data:
Users control what’s shared — only essential data for safety alerts are transmitted, ensuring privacy.

Predictive Safety:
With time, the system learns personal baselines and flags early deviations before they become emergencies.
